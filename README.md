# Smart Agriculture System based on IoT
**Skills Required:**    
IOT Application Development,IOT Cloud Platform  
  
**Project Description:**  
* Smart Agriculture System based on IoT can monitor soil moisture and climatic conditions to grow and yield a good crop.
* The farmer can also get the realtime weather forecasting data by using external platforms like Open Weather API.
* Farmer is provided a mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
* Based on all the parameters he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application.
* Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere.
* Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature,Humidity and Soil Moisture values.
